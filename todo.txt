// Most important to least top to bottom

=====================================================================
Level 10 to 7
=====================================================================
finish armor and weapon inventory ( add functionality to it, base is half assed )


update purchase function to only allow 3 weapons and armors and ten potions
addWeapon and addArmor in purchase function uses player.mNumberOfArmors and player.mNumberOfWeapons
^^ these return the number of items after post-crement

fix/look into rollDamage player function
rollDamage will only do 1 damage, at least with the dagger. look into this


=====================================================================
Level 6 to 4
=====================================================================
finish main.cpp equip function

find player.armorclass bug cuz its defaulting to zero instead of const_baseAC which equals 10

find a better use of player.equip weapon. try to remove the numbers and add a index so we dont get invalid choices and crashes

finish equipWeapon // not checking stuff, add more functions/break down more

split main into managable functions to help with upkeep and such.

add potion types and setup potion arrays
delete potion upon death in fight()
add options to heal with potion during fight?

=====================================================================
Level 3 and under
=====================================================================

look at player and monster class. try to seprate the file and polish it up

polish up showArmor function
add weapon portion to equip from main menu
?? make actual weapon and armor objects memory is dirt cheap so ??

add more variations to enemys, stats, weapons and armor.
